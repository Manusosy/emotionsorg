# Mood Mentors Implementation Strategy

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for implementing the mood mentors side of the Emotions App with the new Supabase backend.

## Phase 1: Setup and Authentication

1. **Configure Supabase Project**
   - Set up the new Supabase project in the dashboard
   - Apply the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql`
   - Configure authentication providers (Email, Google, etc.)
   - Update environment variables in `.env` and `public/env-config.js` files
   - Test authentication connection

2. **Authentication Flow Implementation**
   - Update auth components with new Supabase project credentials
   - Implement role-based signup/login (patient vs. mood mentor)
   - Create auth middleware to protect mentor-specific routes
   - Test full authentication flow for both user types

## Phase 2: Mood Mentor Profile Setup

1. **Profile Management**
   - Create mood mentor profile components
   - Implement profile creation/update functionality
   - Create profile image upload using Supabase storage
   - Add specialty, education, and certifications management

2. **Availability Management**
   - Create availability scheduling interface
   - Implement save/update functionality for mentor availability
   - Create weekly/monthly calendar views for availability

## Phase 3: Appointment Management

1. **Appointment Dashboard**
   - Create appointment list view for mentors
   - Implement filtering by status, date, etc.
   - Create appointment detail view
   - Add appointment status management (confirm, cancel, complete)

2. **Appointment Reports**
   - Create post-appointment report interface
   - Implement report submission functionality
   - Create report history view for mentors

## Phase 4: Messaging System

1. **Messaging Interface**
   - Create messaging inbox for mentors
   - Implement conversation view with patients
   - Add real-time messaging using Supabase realtime
   - Create message notifications

## Phase 5: Reviews and Ratings

1. **Mentor Reviews**
   - Create reviews dashboard for mentors
   - Implement analytics for mentor ratings
   - Add response capability for mentors to reviews

## Phase 6: Patient Dashboard Integration

1. **Connecting Patient Features**
   - Link patient mood tracking to mentor views
   - Create mentor-specific views of patient data
   - Implement mentor recommendations based on mood data

## Phase 7: Testing and Optimization

1. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Test all mentor-specific features
   - Test integration with patient features
   - Performance testing with different data volumes

2. **Optimization**
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries
   - Improve component loading performance
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate

## Implementation Guidelines

### Authentication & Authorization

- Use role-based authorization via Supabase RLS policies
- Keep authentication state in React context
- Implement token refresh and session management

### Data Management

- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Set up proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### UI/UX

- Maintain consistent design language across mentor features
- Ensure responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Implement skeleton loading states for better perceived performance

### Performance

- Minimize unnecessary re-renders using memoization
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement virtualization for long lists

### Testing

- Write unit tests for critical components
- Create integration tests for key user flows
- Set up end-to-end tests for authentication and core functionality
