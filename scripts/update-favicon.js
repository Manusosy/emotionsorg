// Update Favicon Script
/**
 * This script provides instructions for updating the favicon
 * with the new mood tracker image.
 * 
 * Steps to update:
 * 1. We've already created an SVG version at /public/images/mood-tracker-favicon.svg
 * 2. We've updated the HTML reference in index.html
 * 3. You should convert the SVG to ICO format for broader browser support
 * 
 * To convert the SVG to ICO:
 * - Use an online converter such as https://convertio.co/svg-ico/ or https://favicon.io/
 * - Upload the SVG from public/images/mood-tracker-favicon.svg
 * - Download the converted ICO file
 * - Replace public/favicon.ico with the new file
 * 
 * Additional recommendations:
 * - Create multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) for optimal display across devices
 * - Consider creating a set of Apple touch icons and other platform-specific icons
 *   for a complete favicon set
