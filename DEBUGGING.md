# Emotions App Debugging Guide

This document tracks the key issues encountered during development and their solutions to facilitate troubleshooting and production readiness.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Authentication Context Issues

- **Issue**: The `getFullName()` function was missing in the AuthContext.
- **Solution**: Added the `getFullName()` function to the AuthContext interface and implemented it to properly handle different user object structures.
- **Impact**: This fixed display issues in dashboards where user names were being accessed.

### 2. Missing Component Imports

- **Issue**: `ErrorBoundary` component was being used but not imported in the Mood Mentor Dashboard layout.
- **Solution**: Added the import statement for ErrorBoundary.
- **Impact**: Fixed rendering errors in the mood mentor dashboard.

### 3. API Integration Issues

- **Issue**: References to `requiredRole` in DashboardLayout's useEffect dependency array causing errors.
- **Solution**: Removed these references since they were no longer needed.

### 4. Data Service Implementation

- **Issue**: Missing implementation of `subscribeMoodEntries` method in the MockDataService.
- **Solution**: Added the method to the service class and its interface.

### 5. Null Checking in Components

- **Issue**: Missing null checks before calling methods like `toLowerCase()` on potentially undefined values.
- **Solution**: Added proper null checks to avoid runtime errors.

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Authentication & User Management

- [ ] Review and test all authentication flows (sign in, sign up, password reset)
- [ ] Ensure proper role-based access controls are implemented
- [ ] Validate error handling for authentication failures

### Data Layer

- [ ] Ensure proper error handling in all data service methods
- [ ] Test mock data services against real backend services
- [ ] Implement proper data validation for all API calls

### Component Architecture

- [ ] Review error boundary implementation across all routes
- [ ] Ensure consistent import patterns for shared components
- [ ] Test component rendering under different device sizes

### Performance

- [ ] Analyze component re-rendering and optimize where necessary
- [ ] Consider code splitting for larger bundles
- [ ] Implement proper loading states for all async operations

### Testing

- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components and services
- [ ] Implement integration tests for main user flows
- [ ] Test across different browsers and devices

## Common Debugging Tips

### React Component Errors

1. Check for missing imports
2. Verify proper component props are being passed
3. Ensure dependencies arrays in hooks are correctly specified
4. Check for null/undefined values before accessing properties

### Authentication Issues

1. Verify user object structure and access patterns
2. Check localStorage handling for persisted sessions
3. Confirm role-based redirects are working correctly

### API/Data Service Issues

1. Validate mock implementations match real service interfaces
2. Check for proper error handling in async operations
3. Verify data transformation between API and UI
